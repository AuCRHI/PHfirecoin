Notes: o3-03-2018
Deep configuration and corrections.
Fixed deviation of code for cross compile. Reordering of directory structure and source code is
now complete. A more solid working order has been obtained. Errors or warnings within code are more present
and viable. A more sensible order is now working and getting fixed into operation.
Cmake and another compilation are in 
order to be used. A dual compilation option works.

Notes: o3-01-2018
The src/platform area can be changed.
Removing the ones not nessary to drop code size. Like the linux only for linux.
You could actually remove the unessential ones and refix the code needed to function ,for the correct operating system following the platform. This would make 3 version of the base code. Linux and Windows and Mac versions... This sounds really unneeded ,but it could serve a greater purpose. Especially during cross compile ,this could be beneficial.

Notes: o2-21-2018
Most includes are found to be missing across various places in alt coins. Some includes are actually not even present. Code classes are replaced or are created.
Variuos improvements concerning missing
Code or misplaced code has been resolved.
