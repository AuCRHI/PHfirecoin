You will copy the daemon file here and simple wallet.

then in folder testnet2
you will copy just the daemon there.

It will look like this

--testnet1
-------phfired
-------simplewallet

--testnet2
-------phfired

You will first execute the following command 
to fire up the first daemon. This will get things started.

./phfired --p2p-bind-port=28080 --rpc-bind-port=42081 --allow-local-ip

You will then go to the 2nd folder and start up the 2nd daemon to sync the network.
You will use this command to do so.

./phfired --p2p-bind-port=5011 --rpc-bind-port=5010 --add-peer 0.0.0.0:28080 --allow-local-ip

Then after it's synced and you see it comes across the sceeen as if it's seeded.

Now you can start the simplewallet from the first folder.
create a wallet for testing
name = test
password = test

once the simple wallet starts up... your ready for the command inside the wallet.
start_mining

after you watch it mine some blocks? 
you can simply reverse shut down in this order.
=======================================================
Shutdown sequence

exit command on wallet
exit command on daemon from folder testnet2
exit command on daemon from folder testnet1

and that's it.
to restart? testnet1 then testnet2 then simplewallet.
